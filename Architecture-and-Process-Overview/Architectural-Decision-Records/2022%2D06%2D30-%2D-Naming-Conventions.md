Easy to get caught up trying to define the perfect naming conventions but whatever we come up will probably change as we evolve the applications but still worth giving it some forethought.
Propose to start with simple but known conventions and change regularly when we need to. This will also force implementing processes to deal with change (like Infrastructure as Code etc.)

**Github**
Propose the [British Columbia Framework Policy convention](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/Naming-Repos.md) 

Use lowercase and dashes.
Avoid organization monikers.
