Need to run the Build pipeline to build artifacts for each of the platforms.
Navigate to the following pipeline and click "Run Pipeline"
https://dev.azure.com/Malue/Malue%20Proof%20of%20Concept/_build?definitionId=7

**Branch:**
Choose the branch you wish to use.
This will depend on the use case for your build.
A production deploy should always use `main` and policies will be implemented to prevent deployment from any other branch. <To be fleshed out>

**Stages to Run:**
Here you can choose the platform builds you wish to build.
Suggest always including `BuildAndTest` to run unit tests unless doing a debug build.

**Artifacts**
On success the artifacts will be available for manual download, for debug purposes only.
These artifacts will be used in the release process.
