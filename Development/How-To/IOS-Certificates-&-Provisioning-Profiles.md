# Overview

In order to publish an Apple app for use on Apple devices you need a few things:

## 1. Registered App in the Apple Developer Portal
This registers the App with Apple and assigns a unique ID


## 2. A .p12 Certificate
A . p12 file contains the certificates that Apple needs to create and publish apps.


## 3. Provisioning Profile
A provisioning profile is a collection of information that links an application ID to signing certificates and authorized devices.


## 4. A .p8 API Key for App Store Connect
This is used by DevOps to authenticate with TestFlight/AppStore.
